 *    and bounds, active or not. This is the status vector, that is organized
 *    with the (general) constraints first and the bounds after.
 *  - on the other hand it acts as a vector of active constraints, where
 *    element \p i of the vector is the index of an active constraint with
 *    respect to the status vector.
